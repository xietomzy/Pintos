1. In class, we studied the three most important attributes of a thread that the operating system
stores when the thread is not running: program counter, stack pointer, and registers. Where/how
are each of these three attributes stored in Pintos? You may find it useful to closely read switch.S2
and the schedule function in thread.c. You may also find it useful to review Lecture 43 on
September 10, 2019.
